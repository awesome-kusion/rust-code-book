# Preface

When I was working on KusionStack and KCLVM projects, I started to learn the source code of Rustc with the idea of learning the design of excellent compiler. I took some notes and documents during this process. With the suggestion of [Chai](https://github.com/chai2010), I organized them into an article and posted it. I didn't expect people to be interested in it, so I decided to continue writing articles on Rustc source code analysis. This is the original intention of writing this e-book.

KCLVM is a compiler we developed with Rust in the project of Kusion, and some parts of this book are applied to KCLVM. If you are interested in the cloud-native ecology and technology, you can learn about the project &#x1F449; [KusionStack](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion). And if you are interested in Rust, programming languages or compilers, maybe you prefer &#x1F449; [KCLVM]( https://github.com/KusionStack/KCLVM).

Finally, most of the content in these e-book are my personal understanding when reading the source code, as well as some descriptions in the rust-dev-guide. Owing to the limitation of my knowledge, there must be mistakes and errors in the book. So we welcome all forms of conrtibutions(fix typo/correct english/translation/write article or other) from everyone.
